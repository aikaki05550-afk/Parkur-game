🧱 Block Parkour 3D

Block Parkour 3D is a first-person 3D parkour game inspired by Minecraft-style voxel worlds.
The goal is simple: move forward, time your jumps, don’t fall into lava — but mastering it takes skill.

The game focuses on smooth movement, precise jumping, and that satisfying feeling when you finally land a hard jump.

🎮 What the game is about

You play in a blocky 3D world made of grass, stone, platforms, and lava.
Each level challenges your movement skills with longer jumps, higher platforms, and trickier layouts.

There are 20 levels, and every new one is:

longer than the last

harder to complete

more demanding in timing and control

🕹 Controls

W A S D — Move

Mouse — Look around (360° camera)

Shift — Run

Space — Jump

Jumping works like classic parkour games:

Normal jump clears 1 block

Running jump clears up to 2 blocks

👤 Character & Customization

Before starting the game, you can choose:

Gender (boy or girl)

Clothing style (classic, hoodie, parkour)

The character uses a simple blocky design, keeping everything clean and readable while playing in first person.

🌋 Levels & Gameplay Elements

Each level can include:

Floating platforms

Gaps and vertical parkour sections

Lava (instant danger)

Checkpoints to save progress

A portal that marks the end of the level

The further you go, the more the game pushes your accuracy and patience.

🔊 Sound Design

The game uses simple but expressive sound effects:

Soft grass footsteps while walking and running

A quick “whoosh” when jumping

A solid landing sound

Ambient lava sound near hazards

Sounds are there to give feedback without being distracting.
